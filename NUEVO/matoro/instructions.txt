Write a program contained in sphere.c which does the following:
        - declare an array of 100 Spheres
        - Ask the user for the name of the data file
        - Open the data file
        - check to make sure the file opened successfully
        - if the file FAILED to open return to step 2
        - Skip the first two lines of the data file.
        - read the radius and color for an unknown number of Spheres, assume that there is one record per line.
        - you may assume there are fewer than 100 Spheres
        - store each Sphere in the array of Spheres
        - donâ€™t forget to close the data file 
    Once you have read all the data:
        Report the following:
        - Print a list of all Spheres reporting the color, radius, area, and volume
        - Total number of Spheres
        - Percentage of Spheres that are red
        - Total number of Spheres with volume greater than 215.
        - Average area of all Spheres 

All amounts should be rounded to two decimal points.
